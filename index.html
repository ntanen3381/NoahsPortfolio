    <p style = "margin-bottom: 200px; color: gray; font-size: large">For Noah Tanenholtz, building an app using the Android SDK was a challenge. <br>He decided to take an online class
        and learn how to control the Android environment. <br>After he finished his class, he decided to take his aspirations of building a mobile app <br>to the next level. Noah built an app that
        would allow the user to convert different <br>measurements using the standard and metric system, and converting between each <br>system. Noah built his app and deployed it on the
        Google Play Store. Unfortunately, <br>Noah's app (Converjz) did not gain much steam on the app store and another problem <br>arised and would end his development of the app
        all together.

    <h2 style = "font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-large; text-align:start">Trial and Error</h2>
    <p style = "margin-bottom: 200px; color: gray; font-size: large">At some point during his development, Noah occurred an error in Android Studio <br>(the IDE he was using to code his app) and decided to uninstall it'
    thinking that his files <br>for his app would be saved locally during uninstalling and reinstalling the IDE. Unfortunately,<br>he did not know of version control at the time and lost all of his files.
    All that Noah had <br>left of the app was its apk file. He tried to decompile the apk file but only found pre-compiled <br>code and knew that his app was corrupted and the development of his first mobile appl
    was over <br>for good. From this learning experience, Noah grew his development skills and now uses Git for <br>everything and backs up all of his files to Github. </p>

    <p style = "margin-bottom: 200px; color: gray; padding-left: 200px; font-size: large">Noah's interest in computer science started with his development in the Java language. <br>During
    his Sophomore year of High School, Noah took the standard computer science <br>class and learned basic knowledge of the Jave environment. After his sophomore year of <br>high school, Noah
    exeled to AP Computer Science and then onto Advanced Data Structures <br>in his senior. He has since gone through CMSC131 and is currently enrolled in CMSC132. <br>Noah loves Java
        and apparently, Java loves him.</p>

    <p style = "margin-bottom: 100px; color: black; padding-left: 200px; font-size: large">This past semester Noah and two of his friends (Hassan and Peter) met in MATH141 <br>discussion
    class. Peter had built a homemade electric long board and it worked well, <br>but it had some design flaws. Peter designed a new board that can fold and after one <br>prototype built, Lunation
    Boards LLC was born. All three of us applied and went <br>through an interview with Start Up Shell, and they are now our incubator.</p>

    <p style = "margin-bottom: 100px; color: black; padding-left: 200px; font-size: large">Noah is currently the Co-Founder, COO, and Lead Programmer at Lunation Boards LLC and has been
    working on and recently finished a second prototype of the folding long board to show around the school. He is also working very hard on developing the company's website, setting up
    social media, and dealing with general business policies.</p>
