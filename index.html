        <p style = "margin-bottom: 200px; color: gray; font-size: large">For Noah Tanenholtz, building an app using the Android SDK was a challenge. <br>He decided to take an online class
            and learn how to control the Android environment. <br>After he finished his class, he decided to take his aspirations of building a mobile app <br>to the next level. Noah built an app that
            would allow the user to convert different <br>measurements using the standard and metric system, and converting between each <br>system. Noah built his app and deployed it on the
            Google Play Store. Unfortunately, <br>Noah's app (Converjz) did not gain much steam on the app store and another problem <br>arised and would end his development of the app
            all together.
        </p>

        <h2 style = "font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-large; text-align:start">Trial and Error</h2>
        <p style = "margin-bottom: 200px; color: gray; font-size: large">At some point during his development, Noah occurred an error in Android Studio <br>(the IDE he was using to code his app) and decided to uninstall it
            thinking that his files <br>for his app would be saved locally during uninstalling and reinstalling of the IDE. Unfortunately,<br>he did not know of version control at the time and lost all of his files.
            All that Noah had <br>left of the app was its apk file. He tried to decompile the apk file but only found pre-compiled <br>code and knew that his app was corrupted and the development of his first mobile app
            was over <br>for good. From this learning experience, Noah grew his development skills and now uses Git for <br>everything and backs up all of his files to Github. </p>

    <h2 style = "font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-large; text-align:start; padding-left: 200px">Java Loves Me</h2>
    <p style = "margin-bottom: 200px; color: gray; padding-left: 200px; font-size: large">Noah's interest in computer science started with his development in the Java language. <br>During
        his Sophomore year of High School, Noah took the standard computer science <br>class and learned basic knowledge of the Java environment. After his sophomore year of <br>high school, Noah
        excelled to AP Computer Science and then onto Advanced Data Structures <br>in his senior. He has since gone through CMSC 131 and is currently enrolled in CMSC 132. <br>Noah loves Java
        and apparently, Java loves him.</p>

    <h1 style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-large; padding-left: 200px">Startup Shell Shocked</h1>
    <p style = "margin-bottom: 100px; color: black; padding-left: 200px; font-size: large">This past semester Noah and two of his friends (Hassan and Peter) met in MATH 140 <br>discussion
        class. Peter had built a homemade electric long board and it worked well, <br>but it had some design flaws. Peter has recently designed a new board that can fold <br>and after one prototype built, Lunation
        Boards LLC was born. All three of us applied <br>and went through an interview with Start Up Shell. They are now our incubator.</p>

    <p style = "margin-bottom: 100px; color: black; padding-left: 200px; font-size: large">Noah is currently the Co-Founder, COO, and Lead Programmer at Lunation Boards <br>LLC and has been
        working on and recently finished a second prototype of the folding <br>long board to show around the University of Maryland. He is also working very hard <br>on developing the company's website, setting up
        social media, and formatting general <br>business policies.</p>

    </style>
    <p style = "margin-bottom: 100px; color: gray; padding-left: 200px; font-size: large">Throughout this semester, Noah wants to learn more
        about Unity, C++ and C#, databases, <br>Linux environment, and more. He has an interest in all fields of computer science and <br>broadening
        his knowledge would help him to understand computers better. Noah became <br>a computer science because he questioned how computers work
        and how a computer is <br>programmed to understand binary language. These are the things he hopes to learn during <br>his time in the
        FIRE program.</p>
